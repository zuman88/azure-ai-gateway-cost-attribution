variable "consumers" {
  description = <<-EOT
    The chargeback register: who consumes the gateway and who pays for them.

    The key must equal the consumer identity the gateway stamps onto each ledger record, because that
    is the column the workbook joins on. Which value that is depends on how callers authenticate:

      * caller_authentication = "subscription_key"
          The key from the ai-gateway module's `subscriptions` map. That map key becomes the API
          Management subscription id verbatim, and the policy records it as the consumer.

      * caller_authentication = "entra_id"
          The Entra claim value the policy resolved - in practice the calling application's client id.
          These are the same keys you use in the ai-gateway module's `entra_consumer_names`, which
          supplies the friendly label the reports display beside the id.

      * caller_authentication = "both"
          Token-authenticated callers are recorded by claim, key-only callers by subscription id, so
          register whichever identities are actually in use. The ledger's consumerType column records
          which of the two priced each request.

    A consumer that appears in the ledger but not here is not dropped: it is reported with a cost
    centre of "unassigned", which is the signal that the register has drifted from reality.

    Everything else here is finance metadata that Azure has no way of knowing.

    * cost_centre     - The account that gets charged.
    * owner           - Who to contact when the spend looks wrong.
    * monthly_budget_usd - Soft budget used for the per-consumer burn-down in the workbook and, when
                           alerting is enabled, for a spend alert at each threshold percentage.
