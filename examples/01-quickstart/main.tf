# ===================================================================================================
# Example 01 - quickstart
#
# The smallest deployment that is still worth putting in front of a team: one Foundry account, two
# models, a public gateway on Standard v2, and two product tiers with real token ceilings.
#
# What it is for: proving the pattern, running a workshop, or giving an application team something to
# code against on day one. It is not the production topology - example 02 is - but everything in it is
# the same code, so moving between them is a change of variables rather than a rewrite.
#
# Cost note: Standard v2 API Management is billed hourly whether or not anyone calls it. Destroy this
# when you are finished with it.
